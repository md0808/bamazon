# Bamazon
Node application simulating an Amazon-like Storefront.
This application allows users to carry out the functions of a customer or a manager. From the customer entry point, users can view inventory, select the product they want to purchase and the number of that item. The application finds the total amount the user owes, confirms purchase, and updates the database inventory once the sale is completed.
From the manager entry point, the user can view entire inventory, check on low inventory, add more of the existing products, or add entirely new products to the inventory by interfacing with the database.
